TrailFolk

We created this site for the adventurous travelers in all of us. If you've ever had trouble coordinating your outdoor activities in a new place, or wondered about your options for getting outside in your own hometown, TrailFolk was made with you in mind. 

Here you can search hiking and biking trails all over the country, as well as receiving weather forecasts so you can plan and pack confidently.

Get out there!
